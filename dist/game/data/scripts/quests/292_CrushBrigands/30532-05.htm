Welcome back! So you have taken care of the insolent goblins that interfered with our business! Now I'll finally get a good night's sleep! Of course, we need to work very hard to cover last month's loss ... Whew ...<br>
Anyway, you have done well! As promised, I will reward you based on the number and type of necklaces you have brought after killing the goblins. Thanks to your efforts, the insolent brigands have been taught a lesson, but I am still worried ... A freight wagon is departing for Shootguart tonight ... Would you do me another favor?<br>
