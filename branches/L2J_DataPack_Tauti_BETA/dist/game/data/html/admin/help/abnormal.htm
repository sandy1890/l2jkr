Abnormals are special states determined by certain ingame events or conditions, such as Stun, Sleep or Root.<br>
In normal conditions, skills landing will determine whether a certain character must display an abnormal state or not.<br>
From the abnormals menu you can toggle any abnormal on or off either upon a selected target, by providing a character name or a certain radius value.<br>
Have Fun!
